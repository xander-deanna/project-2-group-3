# **Frienemies**  -  [![License: WTFPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)
    
**Frienemies** is new type of social network that allows you to connect with new and interesting people based on hobbies and interests that are different from yours! 

<code>GIVEN I am the user, WHEN I create an account, THEN I am presented a list of friends with different interests. THEN I CAN add friends based on those things I want to learn more about.</code>

The additional npm package we chose is [Cloudinary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudinary). Cloudinary is a cloud service that allows for the upload and retreval of images.
