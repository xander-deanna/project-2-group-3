# Frienemies


## Overview
 We aim to make an app that can be used to connect people with vastly different interests, so that users can broaden their life experience and meet new people. Upon signup, users will answer questions based on their interests. Their answers will then be saved in a database and used to suggest new friends with dissimilar interests. 
<br>
The npm packages we plan on using are [Cloudinary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudinary) along with [Formidable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable) for user-image uploading storage and retrival. We may also impliment [Calandar-Link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/calendar-link) for meet-up scheduling, and [Randomcolor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/randomcolor) to generate colors for user profiles without a profile image.
